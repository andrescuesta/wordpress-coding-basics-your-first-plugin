Being able to write your own plugins lets you write code that you can use in all your sites regardless of the theme. Putting your code in a plugin is usually better practice than using the theme functions file. That way you can switch themes without loosing all the custom code in your site.

In this Coffee Break Course, you'll learn how to write your first simple plugin. You'll see how to configure all the plugin metadata, how to install it in your site, and you'll also get some ideas of simple projects you can build to make your own code more reusable.
